## To-Dos

## Eventual To-Dos
- Add confirmation to sign-up
- Cleanup:
  - Remove newsfeed route from home controller
  - Remove friend request status
- Make posts show author card of some sort, not just name
- Add validation
- Add unfriend functionality
- Make user search form work
- Add styling (maybe, see below)

## Maybe To-Dos
- Make comments and posts have same name for body/content
- Implement interests for profile. Separate table.
- Make location smarter (country, political subdivision, city)
- Make posts also allow images (either just via a URL or, more complicated, by
  uploading one).
- Use the Active Storage to allow users to upload a photo to their profile.
- Make your post able to be either a text OR a photo by using a polymorphic
  association (so users can still like or comment on it while being
  none-the-wiser).
- Style it up nicely! Weâ€™ll dive into HTML/CSS in the next course.
